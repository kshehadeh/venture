There's a lot of information in the world that doesn't make a lot of sense by itself.  But if you connect it to everything else it makes a lot of sense.  In fact, it's inevitable. But we can't understand all the things that made that thing true.  So everything is a surprise.  But sometimes, it's not a surprise.  Maybe it's something you already knew.  Or maybe it's because you know enough about related things so you made a pretty educated guess about it.  Or maybe you just got really lucky.  

But if there was someone who has all the information that happened before and had the mind to hold it and process it then they could tell the future.  At least with much more accuracy than most.  And at least in the not too distant future.  

But what a world.  A world for a person who knows what every next breath brings and what every next step means.  

This is their story.
